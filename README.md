# MK Hack Engine
An ASCII art-based RPG game engine written in Python.

To get started, install the required packages and run 'map_editor.py' with Python 3.7. 

## Features
 - ASCII-based rendering engine borrowing design ideas from Pygame
 - In-engine map editor

## Project status
Thus far, I've only implemented a basic version of the map editor. Currently you can't save or load, but those features will be added shortly.

## Map Editor instructions
 - When you first run the editor, it will generate a blank map of a predefined size
 - The edge of the map is delineated by the pipe char '|'
 - Move the cursor with the arrow keys
 - Add chars at the cursor position with the keyboard
 - Use the tab key to re-enter the last used char
 - Press 'q' to quit
